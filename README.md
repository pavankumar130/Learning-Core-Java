## Learning-Core-Java

### Introduction to Java

Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, and run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java was first released in 1995 and is widely used for developing applications for desktop, web, and mobile devices. Java is known for its simplicity, robustness, and security features, making it a popular choice for enterprise-level applications.

Java was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc in May 1995 and later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It is a simple programming language. Java makes writing, compiling, and debugging programming easy. It helps to create reusable code and modular programs. Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language and is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. A general-purpose programming language made for developers to write once run anywhere that is compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java. Java applications are compiled to byte code that can run on any Java Virtual Machine. The syntax of Java is similar to C/C++.

### Key Features of Java

#### Platform Independent

Compiler converts source code to byte code and then the JVM executes the bytecode generated by the compiler. This byte code can run on any platform be it Windows, Linux, or macOS which means if we compile a program on Windows, then we can run it on Linux and vice versa. Each operating system has a different JVM, but the output produced by all the OS is the same after the execution of the byte code. That is why we call java a platform-independent language.

#### Object-Oriented Programming

Java is an object-oriented language, promoting the use of objects and classes. Organizing the program in the terms of a collection of objects is a way of object-oriented programming, each of which represents an instance of the class.

The four main concepts of Object-Oriented programming are:

    <li> Abstraction </li>
    <li> Encapsulation </li>
    <li> Inheritance </li>
    <li> Polymorphism </li>

#### Simplicity

Java’s syntax is simple and easy to learn, especially for those familiar with C or C++. It eliminates complex features like pointers and multiple inheritances, making it easier to write, debug, and maintain code.

#### Robustness

Java language is robust which means reliable. It is developed in such a way that it puts a lot of effort into checking errors as early as possible, that is why the java compiler is able to detect even those errors that are not easy to detect by another programming language. The main features of java that make it robust are garbage collection, exception handling, and memory allocation.

#### Security

In java, we don’t have pointers, so we cannot access out-of-bound arrays i.e it shows ArrayIndexOutOfBound Exception if we try to do so. That’s why several security flaws like stack corruption or buffer overflow are impossible to exploit in Java. Also, java programs run in an environment that is independent of the os(operating system) environment which makes java programs more secure.

#### Multithreading

Java supports multithreading, enabling the concurrent execution of multiple parts of a program. This feature is particularly useful for applications that require high performance, such as games and real-time simulations.

#### Portability

As we know, java code written on one machine can be run on another machine. The platform-independent feature of java in which its platform-independent bytecode can be taken to any platform for execution makes java portable. WORA(Write Once Run Anywhere) makes java application to generates a ‘.class’ file that corresponds to our applications(program) but contains code in binary format. It provides ease t architecture-neutral ease as bytecode is not dependent on any machine architecture. It is the primary reason java is used in the enterprising IT industry globally worldwide.

#### High Performance

Java architecture is defined in such a way that it reduces overhead during the runtime and at some times java uses Just In Time (JIT) compiler where the compiler compiles code on-demand basis where it only compiles those methods that are called making applications to execute faster.

### Data Types and Variables

#### Data Types in Java

Data types in Java are of different sizes and values that can be stored in the variable that is made as per convenience and circumstances to cover up all test cases. Java has two categories in which data types are segregated

Primitive Data Type: such as boolean, char, int, short, byte, long, float, and double. The Boolean with uppercase B is a wrapper class for the primitive data type boolean in Java.
Non-Primitive Data Type or Object Data type: such as String, Array, etc.

// Java Program to Demonstrate Char Primitive Data Type

// Class
class GFG {

    // Main driver method
    public static void main(String args[])
    {

        // Creating and initializing custom character
        char a = 'G';

        // Integer data type is generally
        // used for numeric values
        int i = 89;

        // use byte and short
        // if memory is a constraint
        byte b = 4;

        // this will give error as number is
        // larger than byte range
        // byte b1 = 7888888955;

        short s = 56;

        // this will give error as number is
        // larger than short range
        // short s1 = 87878787878;

        // by default fraction value
        // is double in java
        double d = 4.355453532;

        // for float use 'f' as suffix as standard
        float f = 4.7333434f;

        // need to hold big range of numbers then we need
        // this data type
        long l = 12121;

        System.out.println("char: " + a);
        System.out.println("integer: " + i);
        System.out.println("byte: " + b);
        System.out.println("short: " + s);
        System.out.println("float: " + f);
        System.out.println("double: " + d);
        System.out.println("long: " + l);
    }

}

#### Variable Scope

The scope of a variable refers to the part of the program where the variable is accessible. Java has three types of variable scopes:

a. Local Scope
Variables declared inside a method or block are called local variables. They are accessible only within that method or block and get destroyed once the method finishes execution.

b. Instance Scope
Variables declared inside a class but outside of any method are called instance variables (non-static). They belong to an instance of the class and can be accessed through object references.

c. Class Scope (Static Variables)
Variables declared with the static keyword are class variables and are shared among all instances of the class.

public class DataTypeDemo {

    // instance variable
    int instanceVar = 100;

    // static variable
    static int staticVar = 200;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // local variable
        int localVar = 300;
        System.out.println("Local Variable: " + localVar);

        // Accessing static variable
        System.out.println("Static Variable: " + staticVar);

        // Accessing instance variable
        DataTypeDemo demo = new DataTypeDemo();
        System.out.println("Instance Variable: " + demo.instanceVar);
    }

}
